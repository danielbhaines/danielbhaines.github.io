# Summary  

The purpose of this project was to build functions to easily pull data from two APIs containing National Hockey League data. In doing this I created two functions: `nhl_records` and `nhl_stats`. A wrapper function `nhl_data` was also created which called either function and allowed for complete control of all variable options within each function.

# Reflection

1. What did you find most difficult?

The most difficult aspect for me was finding the correct syntax to contact the API. Once an object is in R, it is easier to manipulate it to get the data that you need. Bringing the correct information into R was challenging for me.

2. What would you do differently?

If I were to do this again, I would create a rough pseudo-code to explain the process I want to complete and then fill in the gaps with actual code. At times I felt like I was fixing problems as I encountered them instead of anticipating them.

3. What was your biggest takeaway?

My biggest takeaway us that functions or code that you are trying to write as a one-stop for a wide range of tasks need to be planned and coded very carefully. As could be seen with these APIs, sometimes even data from the same source can have the same variables identified by different names, etc. All of these things need to be anticipated in your code.
