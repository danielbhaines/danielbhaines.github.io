# R Project 2

## What would you do differently?  

If I were to do this project again, I would try to automate the reports by creating a list instead of running multiple lines of code. I had difficulty getting that to work properly.

## What was the most difficult part for you?

The most difficult part for me was manipulating the finer details of controlling the tree-based and ensemble based models. I was not entirely confident in some of the smaller changes at first and had to do some extra research on my own.
## What are your big takeaways from this project?

My biggest takeaway from this project is there is ample room in code to automate processes that you might not want to do. It also gives a much 'cleaner' feel to your work when a lot of the uglier code (repitition, etc.) is performed behind the scenes.
