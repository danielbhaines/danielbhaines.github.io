- 1. Thoughts on R vs. other software?

<br>

The other language I have experience in is SAS.
Comparatively speaking, I have a very strong 
preference for R. Because there are many ways to 
do the same task in R, I have had a much easier time
finding and creating functions that perform the task
I need. In that same vein, I have found that in terms
of importing data, R has functions that perform much
of the work behind the scenes.

- 2. What functionality do you like?

<br>

One functionality I particularly like is the help()
functions and available documentation. My experience
with SAS has been that you have to have some knowledge
of the language in order to learn the language, which
is understandably difficult. I have personally found 
the available help and documentation frustrating.

- 3. What do you miss about the other language?

<br>

Truthfully, nothing. Though I will concede SAS has
some powerful analysis tools.

- 4. Do you consider R a difficult language to learn? 
Describe your first experience learning it.

<br>

R has the potential to be challenging because there 
are multiple ways to perform one task. However, I 
enjoy that flexibility and the opportunity to learn
different ways to do things.

<br>

My experience initially learning R was a bit 
challenging because I did not have the 
background in many of the principles of coding
(i.e. conditional logic, etc.)
