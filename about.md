I received my B.S. in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology from the University of Massachusetts in 2016. After graduating, I accepted my first position as a research assistant in a health statistics lab at a research hospital. From my experiences there I developed an appreciation for the need to more robustly handle our data and be able to interpret it to make meaningful decisions. As a result, I applied and enrolled in the Statistics masters program at NC State.

My long term goals is to move away from the bio field and find a position as a data scientist in the tech space.

### Additional Information

I have recently relocated to just south of Worcester, Massachusetts, where I live with my fiancee Maddy and our dog Clover. We are planning (COVID-19 pending) to get married in August of 2021.
